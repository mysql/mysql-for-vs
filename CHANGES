1.2.7
- Added support for VS2017.
- Remove support for VS2010.
- Fixed a problem which prevented MySQL scripts from detecting keyboard input for keys such as Enter,

  (Bug #25713638 - SCRIPT CAN'T GET EDITED AFTER SAVING IT).
- Fixed bug which caused the currently selected schema's db objects to become unselected in the Tree view after unselecting
  a different schema from the Schema list. (Bug #25713981 - EXPORT TOOL IS EXPORTING THE WRONG SCHEMA)


1.2.6
- Fix a bug which prevent users to create a non MySql connection in the Server Explorer pane in VisualStudio 
  after the user create a MySql Connection checking the option "Always use this selection" when selecting 
  the Data Source and Data Provider (MySql Bug #77441, Oracle bug #22122881)
- Fixed the bug that was preventing to "Generate Database from Model" in an existing "edmx" model,
  caused by an invalid path to the Connector/NET assembly in the MySQL T4 templates files 
  (MySql Bug #74388, Oracle bug #20234532).
- Fixed the error being thrown when working with an empty "edmx" model and attempt to generate a database
  from model, due an invalid data in the MySQL "ttinclude" file (Oracle bug #18181649).
- Create a powershell scripts to handle the uninstall/upgrade issue present in any M4VS plugin versions 
  prior to 1.2.5, when having installed VS2012, or VS2013 or VS2015 and the M4VS plugin < 1.2.5, and then
  uninstall VS first, so when trying to uninstall the M4VS the uninstall/upgrade process was being rolled-back.
- Fixed the M4VS plugin version shown in the "Extensions and Updates" Visual Studio menu to reflect the latest
  released version (Oracle bug #22114385).

  version, and then uninstall Visual Studio first, the M4VS plugin couldn't be uninstalled or upgraded
  (MySQL Bug #71226, Oracle Bug #21953055).

  in order to add the "Item Templates" feature with two options: MySQL MVC Item and MySQL Windows Forms Item, 
  available as a context menu for existing projects, which will add a new windows forms or MVC controllers/views 
  connected to MySQL. There is a known issue with item templates not working correctly with MySQL Server 5.7.x,
  avoiding the user to create the entity framework model.
- Added the "Entity Framework" option to the MySQL Website Configuration Dialog, for web projects, so Entity Framework
  version 5 or 6 can be used with a MySQL database provider, automatically adding the configuration/references needed
  to the web.config file and the project itself.
- Fixed the bug where the dataset designer wizard was not showing the stored procedure parameters when creating a 
  "TableAdapter" using existing stored procedures for the "Select" command. Also, fixed the bug where the stored procedure
  command having an "error" command was avoiding the dataset to be created (MySQL Bug #74195, Oracle Bug #20233133).
