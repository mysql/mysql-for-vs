1.2.10
- Upgraded the ANTLR 3 C# Target version used to generate the parser from 3.3.1 to 3.5.2 (Oracle Bug #32398998).
- Updated parser to support syntax changes introduced in MySQL Server 8.0+.
- Removed support for Visual Studio 2015.
- Added support for Connector/NET up to version 8.0.24. Support for later versions should continue to work as expected
  unless any breaking changes are introduced on Connector/NET (Oracle Bug #28752542).
- Switched to the Async Quick Info API to improve UI thread responsiveness when showing tooltips (Oracle Bug #30674699).

  (Oracle Bug #30961816).


1.2.9
- Added support for VS2019.

- Fixed a bug that prevented the creation of data sources due to a failure during the generation of a connection object
  when MySQL Connector/NET 6.10.9+ is installed (MySql bug #91136, Oracle Bug #28148998).
- Fixed a bug that prevented the generation of table adapters when Connector/NET was installed due to a conflict
  with the MySql.Data library. This issue also affected other operations such as attempting to edit a table from the Server
  Explorer. Additional to that, the Configuration Update Tool was added which monitors changes in the installation of Connector/NET
  and when launched, updates MySQL for Visual Studio to be compatible (MySql Bug #82617, Oracle bug #29884031).
- Added validation to prevent Visual Studio from closing unexpectedly when the user attempted to execute a MySQL script
  associated with a closed connection in the Server Explorer (Oracle Bug #29797340).
- The MySQL Workbench and MySQL Utilities buttons located in the MySQL toolbar are now always enabled, instead of being
  enabled only when a connection was selected in the Server Explorer (Oracle Bug #29797355).
- Fixed a bug where attempting to modify the existing installation using the MSI would allow users to target the installation to
  versions of Visual Studio that are not actually installed (MySql Bug #96576, Oracle Bug #30225436).


1.2.8
- Added support for MySQL 8 server features.
- Fixed a bug in which the installation would roll back when Visual Studio 2017 failed to execute devenv commands. This is a
  known issue in Windows 7 environments caused by faulty user permissions. The installer was modified to display a warning
  message in such cases with instructions on how to proceed (MySql Bug #87902, Oracle Bug #27365261).
- Fixed a bug that prevented the MySql.Web assembly from being loaded when using the MySQL Website Configuration Tool
  due to an incorrect way of identifying the version of the assembly (MySql Bug #89446, Oracle Bug #27450530).
- Fixed a bug in which the "Alter Routine" option failed to retrieve the definition of a Store Procedure (Oracle Bug #27669339).

1.2.7
- Added support for VS2017.
- Removed support for VS2010.
- Fixed a problem which prevented MySQL scripts from detecting keyboard input for keys such as Enter,
  Backspace, Arrows, etc. This would only happen after saving the script for the first time.
  (Bug #25713638 - SCRIPT CAN'T GET EDITED AFTER SAVING IT).
- Fixed bug which caused the currently selected schema's db objects to become unselected in the Tree view after unselecting
  a different schema from the Schema list. (Bug #25713981 - EXPORT TOOL IS EXPORTING THE WRONG SCHEMA)


1.2.6
- Fix a bug which prevent users to create a non MySql connection in the Server Explorer pane in VisualStudio 
  after the user create a MySql Connection checking the option "Always use this selection" when selecting 
  the Data Source and Data Provider (MySql Bug #77441, Oracle bug #22122881)
- Fixed the bug that was preventing to "Generate Database from Model" in an existing "edmx" model,
  caused by an invalid path to the Connector/NET assembly in the MySQL T4 templates files 
  (MySql Bug #74388, Oracle bug #20234532).
- Fixed the error being thrown when working with an empty "edmx" model and attempt to generate a database
  from model, due an invalid data in the MySQL "ttinclude" file (Oracle bug #18181649).
- Create a powershell scripts to handle the uninstall/upgrade issue present in any M4VS plugin versions 
  prior to 1.2.5, when having installed VS2012, or VS2013 or VS2015 and the M4VS plugin < 1.2.5, and then
  uninstall VS first, so when trying to uninstall the M4VS the uninstall/upgrade process was being rolled-back.
- Fixed the M4VS plugin version shown in the "Extensions and Updates" Visual Studio menu to reflect the latest
  released version (Oracle bug #22114385).


1.2.5
- Fixed the bug where the "MySQL Workbench" and "MySQL Utilities" buttons were disabled (Oracle Bug #21495692).
- Fixed the bug with the M4VS installer where having any plugin version installed on any Visual Studio
  version, and then uninstall Visual Studio first, the M4VS plugin couldn't be uninstalled or upgraded
  (MySQL Bug #71226, Oracle Bug #21953055).
- Remove the "Project Templates" option from the plugin toolbar button and from the "File -> New -> Project" menu, 
  in order to add the "Item Templates" feature with two options: MySQL MVC Item and MySQL Windows Forms Item, 
  available as a context menu for existing projects, which will add a new windows forms or MVC controllers/views 
  connected to MySQL. There is a known issue with item templates not working correctly with MySQL Server 5.7.x,
  avoiding the user to create the entity framework model.
- Added the "Entity Framework" option to the MySQL Website Configuration Dialog, for web projects, so Entity Framework
  version 5 or 6 can be used with a MySQL database provider, automatically adding the configuration/references needed
  to the web.config file and the project itself.
- Fixed the bug where the dataset designer wizard was not showing the stored procedure parameters when creating a 
  "TableAdapter" using existing stored procedures for the "Select" command. Also, fixed the bug where the stored procedure
  command having an "error" command was avoiding the dataset to be created (MySQL Bug #74195, Oracle Bug #20233133).
  

1.2.4
- Removed support for VS2008.
- Added support for VS2015 so the plugin can be installed properly (MySQL Bug #77708, Oracle Bug #21438524).
