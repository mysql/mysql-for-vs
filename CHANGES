  foreign keys collection (bug #48974)
- fixed entity framework function processing so that it handles stored functions properly
  (bug #45277)

- flushed out many more entires in error code enum (bug #51988)
- changed how we respond when the user selects 'functions return string=true'.  Now we no longer force the type to var string but just let the underlying type come through but we strip the binary flag (bug #52187)
- improved our procedure caching so that if you drop and recreate a proc with a different number of parameters
  it will find the new proc as long as your are actually using the right number of parameters (bug #52562)
