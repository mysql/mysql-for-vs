6.6.0
- Fix for ArgumentNull exception when using Take().Count() in a LINQ to Entities query (bug MySql #64749, Oracle bug #13913047).
- Fix for type varchar changed to bit when saving in Table Designer (Oracle bug #13916560).
- Fix for error when trying to change the name of an Index on the Indexes/Keys editor; along with this fix now users can change the Index type of a new Index which could not be done
  in previous versions, and when changing the Index name the change is reflected on the list view at the left side of the Index/Keys editor (Oracle bug #13613801).
