Version 5.1.5 - 
  - Fixed problem with membership provider where FindUserByEmail would fail trying to add
    a second parameter with the same name as the first (bug #33347)
  - Fixed long standing problem with compression over a network.  It's now fast again. (bug #27865)    
  - Fixed nant compilation problem on mono (bug #33508)
   
Version 5.1.4 - 11/12/2007
  - Fixed issue where column name metadata was not using the charset given on the connection string
    (Bug #31185)
  - Fixed problem where closing the connection before the reader where the reader was
    opened with CloseConnection would cause a object disposed exception to be thrown
  - Fixed problem with installer where the installation would fail if the performance
    counter categories had already been removed for some reason      
  - Fixed problem with attempting to use a command with a connection that is not open.
    The problem was caused by the introduction of the internal method SoftClosed that is
    used with transactions.  (Bug #31262)      
  - Fixed problem where attempting to enlist in a distributed transaction would succeed
    even though Connector/Net doesn't currently support that. (Bug #31703)
  - Fixed problem with web providers not being usable on medium trust systems      
  - Fixed problem with installer where attempting to install over a failed uninstall could 
    leave multiple clients registered in machine.config.  (Bug #31731)      
  - Marked MySqlDbType.Datetime obsolete; replaced with DateTime (just corrected capitalization) (Bug #26344)
  - fixed code where we were returning bit(1) as boolean but mysql treats tinyint(1) as boolean
    (bug #27959)
  - Added the Default Command Timeout connection string option to allow DDEX users to set
    an initial command timeout for very large databases (bug #27958)      
      
Version 5.1.3 - 9/19/2007
  - Fixed problem with using a stored procedure that takes a parameter as a select routine
    for a TableAdapter wizard. (Bug #29098)
  - Fixed problem with creating users using hashed passwords when machineKey is set
    to AutoGenerate.  We now correctly throw an exception if you are requesting
    encrypted passwords but it works ok for hashed passwords. (Bug #29235)
  - Fixed problem with selecting users for roles in the web admin tool.  The problem was that
    we had a simple syntax error in our database lookup code. (Bug #29236)
  - Added AutoEnlist connection string option.  Setting it to false will prevent the connection
    from automatically enlisting in any current transaction    
  - Changed membership schema to allow null values for email.  This allows all the 
    overrides for Membership.CreateUser to work.    
  - Added 'Respect Binary Flags' connection string option to allow existing applications
    to select the old behavior of not always respecting the binary flags of a columns.
  - Added ability to use blobs to store true UTF-8 data (see help)
  - Help is now integrated into Visual Studio 2005 and includes content other than the API 
  - Fixed problem reported by user where MySqlMembershipProvider.GetUser was attempting to 
    reuse the connection to update a table while a reader was open on it.    
  - Fixed problem with membership schema where the password key column was not large enough  
  - Added feature where bit columns that have the value 0 or 1 are returned as bool
  - Added Foreign Key Columns metadata collection
  - Reworked how foreign key metadata is collected to make it more robust and faster
  - Changed DDEX provider to use the core providers schema routines for 
    foreign keys and foreign key columns
  - Fixed index and foreign key enumerators inside the DDEX provider to work
    with the new binary respect behavior of 5.1
  - Added code to implement better TransactionScope support.  This code is brand new and will be
    heavily refactored in 5.2. (bug #28709)
  - Fixed problem where connecting to pre-4.1 servers would result in a crash. This was caused
    by the Field object referring to metadata columns that are not populated on pre-4.1 servers.
    (bug #29476)
  - Commandbuilder now defaults ReturnGeneratedIdentifiers to true.  This means that autogenerated
    columns will be returned in the default case.
  - Exceptions generated during BeginExecuteReader and BeginExecuteNonQuery will now ben thrown
    once the End versions of those methods are called.

Version 5.1.2 - 6/12/2007
  - Fixed integration with the Website Administration Tool.  Before this fix, the test link
    was visible but did not work and  user management did not work.
  - Reintroduced code to properly return field values as byte[] when the binary flag is present.
    (See release notes)    
  - Fixed problem preventing the DataSet Designer or TableAdapter wizard from being
    able to generate insert, update, and delete statements. (Bug #26347)    
  - Fixed problem preventing use of stored procedures for insert, update, and
    delete statements in a table adapter.    
  - Fixed problem where text columns would not appear in the Visual Studio query builder (Bug #28437)	
	    
Version 5.1.1
  - Fixed password property on MySqlConnectionStringBuilder to use PasswordPropertyText 
    attribute.  This causes dots to show instead of actual password text.
  - Fixed problem with pooling on the compact framework.  It should work now.    
  - Install now calls VS setup only when VS integration is selected. (bug #28260)
  - MySqlRoleProvider.GetRolesForUser now works correctly (bug #28251)
  - Installer now adds a default connection string to machine.config.  This will prevent errors related to a missing 
    connection string.  You will need to override this value in your web.config files.    
  - Changed installer to only give option to install Visual Studio integration if Visual Studio 8 is installed

Version 5.1.0 - 5/1/2007

  - Added Membership and Role provider contributed by Sean Wright (thanks!)
  - Now compiles for .NET CF 2.0
  - Rewrote stored procedure parsing code using a new SQL tokenizer.  Really nasty
    procedures including nested comments are now supported.
  - GetSchema will now report objects relative to the currently selected database.
    What this means is that passing in null as a database restriction will report
    objects on the currently selected database only.
    
Version 5.0.9   

  - Fixed problem where fields that were blobs but did not include the BLOB flag were treated
    as binary when they should have been treated as text.  (Bug #30233)    
  - Changed from using Array.Copy to Buffer.BlockCopy in MySqlDataReader.GetBytes.  This
    helps with memory usage as we expect the source and destination arrays to not be overlapping.
    (Bug #31090)
  - Fixed problem that prevented commands from being executed from the state change
    handler.  Not sure why you would want to do this but...  (bug #30964)
  - Fixed problem with connection string caching where our collection class was 
    using case insensitive semantics and this causes cases where a user orginally
    used the wrong case for a user id and then fixed it to still get access denied
    errors. (Bug #31433) 
  - improved the speed of load data local infile significantly   
  - fixed MySqlDateTime.ToString() to properly return the date value (Bug #32010)   
  - fixed problem where string parameters who have their size set after their value could cause exceptions
    (Bug #32094)  
  - fixed problem where old code was preventing creating parameter objects with non-input direction using
    just a constructor (Bug #32093)  
  - fixed problem where a syntax error in a set of batch statements could leave the data adapter in a state
    that appears hung (bug #31930)
  - fixed the MySqlException class to set the server error code in the Data[] hash so that 
    DbProviderFactory users can access the server error code (Bug #27436) 
  - fixed problem where changing the connection string of a connection to one that changes
    the parameter marker after the connection had been assigned to a command but before
    the connection is opened can cause parameters to not be found (bug #13991) 
                            
Version 5.0.8  8/16/2007
  Bug #28706 Log messages are truncated  
  - Fixed a problem with compression over a network.  We were letting the inflate stream read
    directly from the network stream.  Under certain situations, two bytes were being left unread
    and this messed up our byte counts.  Now we are using a WeakReference to an internal buffer
    that we read the compressed data into before inflating. (Bug #28204)  
  - Fixed problem where we were not closing prepared statement handles
    when commands are disposed.
  - Fixed problem where any attempt to not read all the records returned
    from a select where each row of the select is greater than 1024 bytes
    would hang the driver.
  - Fixed problem where usage advisor warnings for unnecessary field conversions
    and not reading all rows of a resultset would output even if you
    did not request usage advisor warnings. (Bug #29124)
  - Changed behavior of ConnectionString property.  It now only returns the connection
    string given to it.  It will not attempt to track changes to the current
    database when the users uses the ChangeDatabase method. (Bug #29123)
  - Fixed problem with calling stored procedures in databases that have hyphens
    in their names.  We were not using backticks to quote the database and sproc name
    when querying for metadata. (Bug #29526)
  - Fixed problem where a statement that has parameters that is executed without
    defining those parameters would throw a System.FormatException rather than
    a MySqlException (bug #29312)    
  - Fixed problem where a command timing out just after it actually finished would cause
    an exception to be thrown on the command timeout thread which would then be seen
    as an unhandled exception. 
  - Fixed bug where Connecor/Net was hand building some date time patterns rather than using
    the patterns provided under CultureInfo.  This caused problems with some calendars that do
    not support the same ranges as Gregorian.  (Bug #29931)
  - Fixed problem where MySqlConnection.BeginTransaction checked the drivers
    status var before checking if the connection was open.  The result was that the
    driver could report an invalid condition on a previously opened connection.    
  - Fixed problem where an attempt to open a connection max pool size times while
    the server is down will prevent any further attempts due to the pool semaphore
    being full. (Bug #29409)    
  - Fixed some serious issues with command timeout and cancel that could present
    as exceptions about thread ownership.  The issue was that not all queries 
    cancel the same.  Some produce resultsets while others don't.  ExecuteReader
    had to be changed to check for this.
  - Fixed problem where date columns that appear in keys caused updates to 
    fail (bug #30077)
  - Added code to suppress finalizers for low level socket objects and then
    added a finalizer to the protocol object so pooled connections will get 
    closed on process exit    
  - Fixed problem where attempting to load a reader into a datatable using a table 
	with a multi-column primary key would result in multiple constraints being added
	to the datatable. No test case added to the 1.0 tree as loading a datatable
	with a reader is a .Net 2.0 thing. (Bug #30204)
  - Fixed the database schema collection so that it works on servers that are not properly
    respecting the lower_case_table_names setting.	
  - Moved installer to Inno Setup

  Other changes
  -------------
  Return parameters created with DeriveParameters now have the name RETURN_VALUE
  Fixed problem with parameter name hashing where the hashes were not getting updated
       or removed in certain situations.
  Fixed problem with calling stored functions when a return parameter was not given
  Fixed problem that prevented use of SchemaOnly or SingleRow command behaviors with
       sprocs or prepared statements
  Assembly now properly appears in the Visual Studio 2005 Add/Remove Reference dialog
  Added MySqlParameterCollection.AddWithValue and marked the Add(name, value) method as obsolete
  Added "Use Procedure Bodies" connection string option to allow calling procedures without
       using procedure metadata (if possible).
  Reverted behavior that required parameter names to start with the parameter marker.  We 
       apologize for this back and forth but we mistakenly changed the behavior to not
       match what SqlClient supports.  We now support using either syntax for adding
       parameters however we also respond exactly like SqlClient in that if you ask for the
       index of a parameter using a syntax different than you added the parameter, the result
       will be -1.

       no longer required select privs on mysql database.  This is not true and select privs
       are required. This will be fixed when the server exposes procedure parameters via
       information schema.]

  Other changes
  -------------
  Increased speed of MySqlParameterCollection.IndexOf(string) orders of magnitude
  (parameter name lookups are now strict on use of parameter marker)
  Improved character set mappings
  Turned MySqlPoolManager into a static class and added a static ctor to
    avoid any race conditions related to initializing the hashtable.
    (A similar suggestion came in from a user)
  Added 'Ignore Prepare' connection string option for disabling prepared
    statements application-wide
  Added Installer class to provide custom install type procedures such as modifying
    machine.config

* Fixed bug inside CommandBuilder that prevented inserts from happening properly
* Reworked some of the internals so that all three execute methods of Command worked properly
* FIxed many small bugs found during benchmarking

4/5/2003
* The first cut of CoonectionPooling is working. "min pool size" and "max pool size" are respected.

4/3/2003
* Work to enable multiple resultsets to be returned
* Character sets are handled much more intelligently now.  The driver queries MySQL at startup for the default character set.
  That character set is then used for conversions if that code page can be loaded.  If not, then the default code
  page for the current OS is used.  

3/31/2003
* Added code to save the inferred type in the name,value ctor of Parameter
* Also, inferred type if value of null parameter is changed using Value property
* Converted all files to use proper Camel case.  MySQL is now MySql in all files.  PgSQL is now PgSql
* Added attribute to PgSql code to prevent designer from trying to show

3/17/2003
* Added MySQLDbType property to Parameter object and added proper conversion code to convert from DbType to MySQLDbType)
* Removed unused ObjectToString method from MySQLParameter.cs
* Fixed Add(..) method in ParameterCollection so that it doesn't use Add(name, value) instead.
* Fixed IndexOf and Contains in ParameterCollection to be aware that parameter names are now stored without @ 
* Fixed Command.ConvertSQLToBytes so it only allows characters that can be in MySQL variable names
* Fixed DataReader and Field so that blob fields read their data from Field.cs and GetBytes works right
* Added simple query builder editor to CommandText property of MySQLCommand
* Fixed CommandBuilder and Parameter serialization to account for Parameters not storing @ in their names
* Removed MySQLFieldType enum from Field.cs.  Now using MySQLDbType enum

3/15/2003
* Added Designer attribute to several classes to prevent designer view when using VS.Net

3/13/2003
* Fixed Initial catalog typo in ConnectionString designer
* Removed 3 parameter ctor for MySQLParameter that conflicted with (name, type, value)
* changed MySQLParameter so paramName is now stored without leading @ (this fixed null inserts when using designer)
* Changed TypeConverter for MySQLParameter to use the ctor with all properties

0.68
========================================================================
Note that this build has not been checked out with Mono.  

3/10/2003
* Fixed sequence issue in driver

3/9/2003
* Added DbParametersEditor to make parameter editing more like SqlClient
* Fixed Command class so that parameters can be edited using the designer

3/7/2003
* Update connection string designer to support Use Compression flag

2/15/2003
* Fixed string encoding so that European characters like Ò¤ will work correctly

2/9/2003
* Creating base classes to aid in building new data providers
* Added support for UID key in connection string

2/10/2003
* Field, parameter, command now using DBNull.Value instead of null
* CommandBuilder using DBNull.Value
* CommandBuilder now builds insert command correctly when an auto_insert field is not present
* Field now uses typeof keyword to return System.Types (performance)

0.65
====================
* MySQLCommandBuilder now implemented
* Transaction support now implemented (not all table types support this)
* GetSchemaTable fixed to not use xsd (for Mono)
* Driver is now Mono-compatible!!
* TIME data type now supported
* More work to improve Timestamp data type handling

0.60
======================
* Protocol compression  using SharpZipLib (www.icsharpcode.net)
* Named pipes on Windows now working properly
* Work done to improve Timestamp data type handling
* Implemented IEnumerable on DataReader so DataGrid would work
 
0.50
======================
