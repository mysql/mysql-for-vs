Version 6.1.3

- in sessionState provider, timeout value was read from the wrong (root) web.config (bug#47815)
- fixed crash that can occur when oldGuids are used and binary(16) column  used for GUID 
  contains a null value (thanks Troy!) (bug#47928)
- fixed indexes schema collection so that it still works with bad table names such as b``a`d (bug #48101)

Version 6.1.2
- fixed hanging after losing network connectivity to server (bug#43761) 
  Better fix is planned for 6.2
- removed ReturnGeneratedIdentifiers.  We are now treating the command builder exactly
  the same way SqlClient does

- fixed typo in asp.net config wizard  
  
Version 6.1.1
- lots of bug fixes merged up from 6.0.5

Version 6.1.0
- Added new MySQL Website Configuration Wizard
- Now supports native inout and output parameters when in prepared mode and running against a server
  that supports it
- Changed our native guid support to char(32)
- Added a connection string option 'old guids=yes|no' to allow users who have older applications
  to continue using binary(16) guids
