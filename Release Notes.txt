Connector/Net 6.1  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.1

What's new in 6.1
--------------------
This release introduces a couple of exciting new features.

Website Configuration Dialog -- This is a new wizard that is activated by clicking
a button on the toolbar at the top of the solution explorer.  It is meant to work in
conjunction with the ASP.Net administration pages.  It makes it easier to activate 
and set advanced options for the different web providers we include.

Session State Provider -- We are now including a session state provider that allows
you to store your websites state in a MySql server.  

Support for native output parameters -- With this release we now support native output
parameters when connected to a server that supports them.  Currently we know that includes
6.0.8 and later servers.  It also will include 5.4 servers.

Changed GUID type -- We have changed our backend representation of a guid type to be
CHAR(36).  We are doing this because we feel users will want to use the server UUID() function
to populate a guid table and UUID generates a 36 character string.  Developers of older
applications can add 'old guids=true' to the connection string and the old binary(16) type will be used.

What we know may be broken
----------------------------
- Documentation is not updated yet.
- Although the session provider is included in the web providers it is currently not
  included in the website configuration wizard.
- Our entity framework support currently treats both binary(16) and char(36) columns as 
  guids.   
- We have refactored a good bit of the internal piping to support output parameters but
  also to set us up for future features such as client side query caching.  What I saying
  is that we may have broken some fairly major stuff so be sure and test against safe 
  data and please don't deploy until we are GA and you are confident.
- The button for bringing up the website config wizard doesn't appear unless you have created
  a data connection to a MySQL server in server explorer. 
- The website configuration wizard is a bit fragile when it launches.  You should have a
  website project loaded and selected and it should work.   

Please let us know what else we broke and how we can make it better!
