Connector/Net 6.3  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.3

What's new in 6.3
--------------------

- Support for Visual Studio 2010
- Nested transaction scopes now work though they still must use the same connection (no XA)
- The ability to enable query analysis at runtime
- New SQL editor

What we know is broken
----------------------
- Documentation has not been integrated into VS2010 yet.  We are having trouble with silent integration
  of documentation files.  We will include this in a future release.

- The Generated Database Wizard will save the file with the extension .sql.  You will need to
  manually change the extension to .mysql to use the new editor.

What we changed in 6.3.7
------------------------
We introduced a slight change in behavior with 6.3.7.  We did this as part of a larger change to address a performance
issue.  It's a relatively minor change in behavior however we encourage you to read this section carefully and review your 
application for areas that might be affected.

We have made the Use Procedure Bodies flag obsolete and introduced the Check Parameters option.  They server mainly the
same purpose.  The Check Parameters option is true by default.  Setting to false tells
Connector/Net to not fetch any routine or parameter metadata and to simply trust what the user has specified.  This can greatly 
increase performance but it also puts significant pressure on the application developer to give the parameters in the right
order.

The next change in behavior is that Connector/Net no longer allows you to call a stored function without specifying a return value.
We are now using the presence of a return value parameter as a signal that we should execute the routine as a stored function.  If
you don't care about the return value, then give a place holder value.

The next change is that if you user has insufficient permissions to retrieve parameter metadata, 
you are not connecting to server 5.5 or later, and you have specified Check Parameters then the connector will throw an 
InvalidOperationException indicating that you have insufficient privileges to retrieve routine parameter metadata. In the past the
connector would silently use the parameters you gave on the command.

We apologize for introducing these changes in a GA product but we felt it was important as these changes greatly increase the
speed that we execute stored routines.
