Connector/Net 5.1 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 5.1

This is a fairly minor change however we encourage you to review the changelog 
to see the specific changes.

Treat Tiny As Boolean
---------------------
The only significant change to existing behavior is the addition of the 
'Treat Tiny As Boolean' connection string option.  By default, this setting is
true which means that any TINYINT(1) columns it sees will be treated as boolean.
However, if you don't want this behavior just set this setting to false and those
columns will be returned as integers
