Connector/Net 6.0  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.0

Known Issues
------------
* The table editor in the Visual Studio integration will shorten the window name when you save.  This has no
real effect on the function of the editor but it is not quite correct.

* Our visual studio editors are completely rewritten and we expect to find some 1.0 type bugs after release.  We will
update these quickly and we ask for your patience.

* Our sql editor does not correctly display items with comments properly.  This is easily worked around and will be
fixed in the next release

* Currently unsigned int values are not supported in our entity framework support.  We are planning on adding
this in the next release.

* This release does not treat tinyint(1) columns as boolean in entity framework.  It is uncertain if we will
even be able to support bool in this way and may have to use a different column spec for bool.  We are working
to fix this in the next release.

We understand that the last two issues above can effect a great number of people and so we are working hard to 
update the release very quickly.  

We hope you enjoy this release and encourage you to test this release with your applications
and let us know any problems you find.
