Connector/Net 6.0  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.0

What's new in 6.0.4?
--------------------
This is the first post-GA release of 6.0 and we really wanted to address some of the bugs that were in the
initial GA release.  Here are the highlights:

* Added bool and guid support to our entity framework bits
* Added SunConnect registration to the installer.  Please register!
* Our Visual Studio integration bits should compile better under VS2005
* Unsigned values are not supported with our entity framework bits
* Many other significant bug fixes.  Check the change log!

Known Issues In 6.0.4
---------------------
* The table editor in the Visual Studio integration will shorten the window name when you save.  This has no
real effect on the function of the editor but it is not quite correct.

* Our visual studio editors are completely rewritten and we expect to find some 1.0 type bugs after release.  We will
update these quickly and we ask for your patience.


Data type support in Entity Framework
-------------------------------------
tinyint(1) columns are transparently treated as boolean columns

binary(16) columns are transparently treated as guid columns

unsigned data types are now supported
Unsigned integer types are not directly supported in the entity framework.  We are working around
that by mapping those columns to the next higher signed integer type.

For example, an unsigned integer column will appear in an entity framework model as a
Int64 column.  This allows  your application to set a value up to the maximum value for 
an unsigned int32 column and preserve the value.  However, be aware that if you set a signed 
value or exceed the maximum value for your underlying database column, data truncation will occur.
The moral of the story is if you are going to use unsigned types (discouraged) then know what
your underlying column types are and don't exceed their max sizes.
