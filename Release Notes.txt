Connector/Net 6.2  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.2

What's new in 6.2
--------------------

- Idle connection pool cleanup.  We now use a timer thread to clean up dead connections from
  the connection pool.
- Command timeout has been refactored to use network and stream timeouts instead of a timer.  The
  result of this is that fewer system resources are used and the system should be more reliable.
- Completely refactored MySqlConnectionStringBuilder
- Completely refactored logging system.  It now users fewer cycles when logging is not enabled. 
  It also logs more information such as query time, number of results, and number of rows returned
  by a query.  It also keeps all the information for a given query together so it is easier to 
  follow in the log.


Issues in this release
----------------------
This is a beta release and, as such, we know of some test failures.  We are sure there are bugs
in this release so we encourage you to use this release to see and test the new features but do
not use it in a production setting.

The documentation has not yet been completed.  We apologize for the delay in 6.2 documentation but
we felt it was important to get the beta build out so users can test it.
