MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.4 MR Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.4

This is a maintenance release for the MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1 series, and it is suitable for production environments. 
It is compatible with Connector/Net 6.8.3 and later, and it supports MySQL 

Server versions 5.0 to 5.6.

* Introduced a new MySQL toolbar, which provides shortcuts to some of the main functionalities of MySQL for Visual Studio. 
  See The MySQL Toolbar for details.

Bugs Fixed:
* The MySQL parser did not recognize the full string literal syntax of [_charset_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name] 
  as supported by the MySQL Server. This fix makes Connector/Net and MySQL for Visual Studio recognize the string literal 
  syntax as specified in the Character String Literal Character Set and Collation section of the MySQL Server manual.
* In Visual Studio, the stored procedure debugger did not evaluate the last_insert_id() function in a watch expression correctly.
  This fix also corrects similar issues for two other information functions that query the debug data table: 
  row_count() and found_row().
* A new model could not be created with Entity Framework 6 in Visual Studio 2013 when using MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.3 
  and Connector/Net 6.8.3.
* The MySQL parser could not parse an if statement when there were any spaces before the parenthesis for the arguments 
  (for example, “if (1,1, 1)”). Besides if, the same issue occurred for a number of other functions like row_count, ifnull, mod, 
  repeat, and so on, and this fix corrects the problem for all of them.
* When debugging a stored routine in Visual Studio with the debugger, long identifiers caused the error "data too long for column 
  'pvarname'" to be thrown. That was because the SQL script of the debugger did not support the same lengths for identifier names 
  as the MySQL server does. This fix matches the debugger with the MySQL server on the maximum lengths supported for identifier names.




MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.3 GA Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.3 GA

This is the first GA release in the MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1 series, and it is a version suitable for production environments. 
It is compatible with Connector/Net 6.8.3, and it supports MySQL 

Server versions 5.0 to 5.6. 

It includes the following features:
* Integration with Visual Studio 2013 (requires Professional Edition or higher)
* Integration with Connector/Net 6.8.3
* Support for Entity Framework 6 new designers in Visual Studio 2013 (requires Connector/Net 6.8.3)
* A new data export tool

Bugs Fixed:

* Intellisense showed views from all databases, instead of just the current one.
* The debugger failed with parser errors when debugging stored procedures with a Leave statement.




MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.2 RC Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.2 RC

Bugs Fixed:

  and Connector/Net 6.7.5.
* When opening or creating a .mysql file, trying to invoke Intellisense caused an error in some cases.
* Debugger failed to debug a routine correctly when it had two functions in a single expression. That was due to an error
  in handling the scope of the second function, which has been fixed.

MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.1 Beta Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Visual Studio 1.1.1 Beta

* Added support for Entity Framework 6 for creating a model using Database First and Model First.
* The registration of the Data provider in the machine.config file is no longer performed by MySQL for Visual Studio, 
  but is performed during the installation of Connector/Net (from 6.8.1 and on). 

Also, the registration is no longer needed when using MySQL for Visual Studio only.

Bugs Fixed:
* When trying to edit or alter a stored procedure or trigger that included references to session variables, an error occurred 
  and the changes were not saved, unless Allow User Variables=true was in the connection settings. Besides stopping the error, 
  this fix also stops similar issues with renaming stored procedure or trigger using Alter Routine.
* Generation of database from a simple model failed in Visual Studio 2012.

Known Issues
--------------------
* In order to generate a database from a simple model in 2012, you have to select the correct DDL Generation Template as an 
  entity property. Also, there is a known issue found with Visual Studio 2010, which forces the user to go back and forth 
  between steps in order to create the SQL script.
