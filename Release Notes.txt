Table Caching
-------------
We have not yet updated the documentation so we write a few words on table caching here.

Table Caching is a new feature that users can use to cache slow-changing datasets on the client side.  This is useful for apps
that are designed to use readers but you still want to minimize trips to the server for slow-changing tables.

It is transparent to the user.  It is not enabled by default.

To enable caching, add 'table cache=true' to your connection string.  You can also use the 'Default Table Cache Age'
connection string option to specify the number of seconds a table is cached before being discarded.  You can also
set caching and cache age options on a per command basis.  Please note that the cache age property is in "seconds".

In the future we may extend this feature to allow the end user to provide their own implementation or we may provide
an implementation of table caching that can take advantage of services such as memcached or velocity.
