Connector/Net 6.3  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.3

What's new in 6.3
--------------------

- Support for Visual Studio 2010
- Nested transaction scopes now work though they still must use the same connection (no XA)
- The ability to enable query analysis at runtime
- New SQL editor


What we know is broken
----------------------
- Documentation has not been integrated into VS2010 yet
- The Generated Database Wizard will save the file with the extension .sql.  You will need to
  manually change the extension to .mysql to use the new editor.  We hope to resolve this for GA
