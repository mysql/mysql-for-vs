Connector/Net 6.0  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.0

What's new in 6.0.5?
--------------------
- Added Keepalive connection option
- Fixed some problems with our unsigned type support in entity framework
- Added methods to allow type-safe cloning on connection, parameter, and command objects
- We now expose the MySqlDecimal type to support decimal values greater than what System.Decimal can handle
- Lots of bug fixes (check the changelog)

Known Issues In 6.0.5
---------------------
* The table editor in the Visual Studio integration will shorten the window name when you save.  This has no
real effect on the function of the editor but it is not quite correct.


Data type support in Entity Framework
-------------------------------------
tinyint(1) columns are transparently treated as boolean columns

binary(16) columns are transparently treated as guid columns

unsigned data types are now supported
Unsigned integer types are not directly supported in the entity framework.  We are working around
that by mapping those columns to the next higher signed integer type.

For example, an unsigned integer column will appear in an entity framework model as a
Int64 column.  This allows  your application to set a value up to the maximum value for 
an unsigned int32 column and preserve the value.  However, be aware that if you set a signed 
value or exceed the maximum value for your underlying database column, data truncation will occur.
The moral of the story is if you are going to use unsigned types (discouraged) then know what
your underlying column types are and don't exceed their max sizes.
